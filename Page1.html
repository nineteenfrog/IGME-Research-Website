        <p><Strong>What is Stealth Marketing?</Strong><br>
        Stealth Marketing is, as the name implies, marketing that is done stealthily. It consists of subtle messages that get to the public through actions and desicions made by companies. These video game companies advertise their games by using memes and supporting an involved community, Then this community does the job of promoting a game. One example is the "You're Breathtaking" meme that happened at e3. This gave the game <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> a lot of free advertisement because people were into the memes.</p>

        <p>Another example is how games like <i>Fortnite</i> sell a lot of merchandise relating to their game. Believe it or not, this merchandise is also part of the advertisements. People look these items on stores and ask themselves "What is this game?" then they start investigating and if enough interest is accumulated, they might even consider playing it. That is how they get indirect advertisement. </p>
