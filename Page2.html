        <p><strong>What are eSports?</strong><br>
            eSports stands for "electronic sports" or in other words, competitive video games. Video games can sometimes develop a competitive scene and then big eSports events are organised to support the scene. These events generate a lot of money and they bring in teams that compete to the international level for prize pools that sometimes <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/mikestubbs/2019/07/27/the-international-9-dota-2-tournament-prize-pool-breaks-30-million/#f546fbd2c07c" class="link">get to the millions</a></p>

        <p>Game companies invest in these competitions by providing proze pools for the people who compete and by hosting streams which also attract thousands of viewers. These also promote a game. People involved in a competitive game tend to be more involved in the game and also tend to promote it more. That is why game companies will always support a competitive scene for a game.</p>
